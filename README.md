# Vue project ⚡

💻 This repository is an extension of the FastApi-Cloudinary-PostgreSQL repository. The latter was the backend part of the online store, and this repository is the frontend part 📌

🌐 This repository is the frontend part of the online store. It uses routing and the Cloudinary server for managing product images. The backend part, along with the PostgreSQL queries, is handled in a separate repository that I mentioned earlier 👆

⚠️ Backend requests are intercepted by Nginx on the shared domain. However, you can modify the requests to suit your needs.
